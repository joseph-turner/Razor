#Razor Syntax Definition - Sublime Text 2
##Syntax Definition for Razor (cshtml) in Sublime Text 2

###Overview
Having been unable to find a Razor Syntax Definition for Razor anywhere, I decided to do this myself. While it's not perfect, it works much better than nothing. For more information on [Razor](http://www.asp.net/web-pages/tutorials/basics/2-introduction-to-asp-net-web-programming-using-the-razor-syntax), check out this great quick [reference](http://haacked.com/archive/2011/01/06/razor-syntax-quick-reference.aspx) done by Phil Haack (@haacked).

###Instructions
Tested on Windows and Mac. 

**Mac OS X**: clone this to: ~/Users/{User}/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User. It should automatically recognize the syntax based on the file extension. 

You can also download the .zip file then in Sublime Text 2 go to Preferences -> Browse Packages -> (Packages directory will be opened in finder) copy the .zip file contents over to the /User directory (may have to overwrite existing files).

**Windows**: clone this to: %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User which expands to something like 
`C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User` on Windows Vista/7


###Extend/Improve
Like I said, it's far from perfect, mostly because I've never done this before. I'm pretty new to JSON and Regex, so if you can do better, by all means! Check out the [Sublime Text](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/reference.html) reference site for details.
