#Razor Syntax Definition - Sublime Text 2
##Syntax Definition for Razor (cshtml) in Sublime Text 2

###Overview
Having been unable to find a Razor Syntax Definition for Razor anywhere, I decided to do this myself. While it's not perfect, it works much better than nothing. For more information on [Razor](http://www.asp.net/web-pages/tutorials/basics/2-introduction-to-asp-net-web-programming-using-the-razor-syntax), check out this great quick [reference](http://haacked.com/archive/2011/01/06/razor-syntax-quick-reference.aspx) done by Phil Haack (@haacked).

###Instructions
I've only tested this on Mac so I have no idea if it will do any better or worse in other operating systems. So on Mac OS X, clone this to: ~/Users/User/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User. It should automatically recognize the syntax based on the file extension.

###Extend/Improve
Like I said, it's far from perfect, mostly because I've never done this before. I'm pretty new to JSON and Regex, so if you can do better, by all means! Check out the [Sublime Text](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/reference.html) reference site for details.
